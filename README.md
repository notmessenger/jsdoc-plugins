# defaultTag

Adds `@default` tag to those DocBlocks that should have it

From a code comment perspective the `@default` tag does not add much value when viewing it inline.  However it does
have value in the documentation it assists in generating.  This plugin allows you to not have to include the
`@default` tag in DocBlocks that are not for complex data types and have it be automatically added to the DocBlocks
for you during documentation generation.
